      <h2>About TMAC</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        TMAC is a new permanent home for Toronto’s media arts organizations, and
        an
        <b>accessible public space for art</b>, creation and collaboration in
        the Queen West Triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the heart of Toronto’s Art and Design District, TMAC is a diverse and

      <h2>How we operate</h2>
      <p>
        TMAC is managed by a board of directors comprised of one representative
        from each member organization, and two community stakeholders
        representing the local neighborhood and the broader Toronto media arts
        community. TMAC currently has no staff, and is 100% volunteer-run.

        Each member organization has its own workspace, some with offices and
        classrooms, others with a gallery or film vault. Each member
        organization takes an active role in our collective programming:
        Supporting users of the exhibition spaces; promoting TMAC; and
        developing a sustainable, equitable model for a collaborative centre
        that supports our artistic, cultural, and community-based mandate.

                Read about our dispute with the City of Toronto and Urbancorp
                over the facility.

            <p>
              TMAC grew out of grassroots community support and in response to a
              need for an accessible and affordable centre dedicated to media
              art and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea for TMAC was first conceptualized in 2003, after almost
              15 years of organizing. TMAC incorporated in 2011 and attained
              charitable status in 2013. Today, TMAC has organically grown into
              an integrated collaborative organization supporting its members,
              the West Queen West community, and all of Toronto’s media artists
              and artist-run centres.

              TMAC, Urbancorp and the City of Toronto finalized an agreement
              that would provide the Edge on Triangle Park condominium a density

              <strong>turnkey, purpose-built, 38,000 sq. ft. facility</strong>
