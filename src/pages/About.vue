          <h3>Governance</h3>
          <p>
            TMAC is managed by a board of directors comprised of one
            representative from each member organization, and two community
            stakeholders representing the local neighborhood and the broader
            Toronto media arts community. TMAC currently has no staff, and is
            100% volunteer-run.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each member organization has its own workspace, some with offices
            and classrooms, others with a gallery or film vault. Each member
            organization takes an active role in our collective programming:
            Supporting users of the exhibition spaces; promoting TMAC; and
            developing a sustainable, equitable model for a collaborative centre
            that supports our artistic, cultural, and community-based mandate.

                  Read about our dispute with the City of Toronto and Urbancorp
                  over the facility.
                </a>
              </p>
              <p>
                TMAC grew out of grassroots community support and in response to
                a need for an accessible and affordable centre dedicated to
                media art and technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea for TMAC was first conceptualized in 2003, after almost
                15 years of organizing. TMAC incorporated in 2011 and attained
                charitable status in 2013. Today, TMAC has organically grown
                into an integrated collaborative organization supporting its
                members, the West Queen West community, and all of Toronto’s
                media artists and artist-run centres.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2014, with the support of the local community, City staff,
                <a href="http://active18.net">Active 18</a> and Councillor
                <a href="http://www.anabailao.com/developments">Ana Bailão</a>,
                TMAC, Urbancorp and the City of Toronto finalized an agreement
                that would provide the Edge on Triangle Park condominium a
                density bonus in exchange for a
                <strong>turnkey, purpose-built, 38,000 sq. ft. facility</strong>
                for TMAC.
