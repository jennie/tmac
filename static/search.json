The space is alive with activity every day and night of the week, with exhibitions, receptions, classes and workshops; filmmakers, game designers, curators, composers and other media artists experimenting and creating in every space we have to offer. \n\n## Space to experiment \n\nSupporting the day-to-day users of our space – artists, neighbors and members – means dreaming with them about what this facility can be beyond a great place to gather, work and learn.\n\nSomething that has resonated with everyone is the creative possibilities that maturing augmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies (known collectively as XR) have opened up. \n\nIntegrating traditional and new modes of storytelling, XR bridges film, video games, digital culture, performance and art. It gives audiences access to different points of view, and engages them in ways that would otherwise not be possible.\n\nBut the tools to create can be inaccessible – the higher-end headsets are hundreds or thousands of dollars, workstations with capable video cards are two to three times the cost of most production laptops, real-scale multi-user immersive rooms are not available to individual creators, and shooting studios for motion and volumetric capture are expensive and strictly limited to commercial users.\n\nWhat if anyone could freely experiment with technology that has the potential to expand how we create, experience and share stories? What happens when artists get their hands on platforms and tools that weren’t made for them, and the developers listen to their ideas and connect them with new peers and audiences? We want to find out!\n\n### Partners who fit\n\nTMAC has selected partners that can solve this need within the media arts sector who have a strong cultural fit, values alignment and ability to make contributions that provide intrinsic value to the community. In addition to financial support, their sponsorship sets the stage for research and development activities and wild creative experimentation through free and affordable access to leading-edge technology.\n\nNot only that, these partnerships will allow TMAC to make improvements to all of our presentation and work spaces (finishing work [the developer did not](/news/open-letter-re-the-cultural-space-at-36-lisgar)) and connect us with a broad network of creators and funders across Canada and internationally.\n\nOur partners bring benefits that work in concert with one another, reflecting TMAC’s collaborative, inclusive values and amplifying the possibilities and potential each enables. \n\n### Partners in creative experimentation\n\nThese partnerships will result in two three new initiatives that will provide free access to hardware, software, services and facilities to artists experimenting with immersive experiences, spatial computing and distributed content production.\n\n**Ubisoft** and TMAC are working on something amazing we're keeping under wraps for now!\n\n**Virtualware** will bring its real scale, multi-user immersive room technology – including equipment, hardware and software suite for generating and updating content in real time – to TMAC to foster the creation of new immersive cinema experiences, allow for the exploration of interactive digital performance, and enable truly immersive storytelling and explorations of human interaction within virtual spaces.\n\n**Beanfield** has supported TMAC with best-in-class fiber connectivity and high-capacity wireless service (freely available to anyone in TMAC!) since day one. But that's just the beginning.\n\nBeanfield‘s access to SirtNET will provide TMAC with opportunities to access cloud-based processing services for rendering images and video, on-demand software suites, and other normally cost-prohibitive server functionality.\n\nAdditionally, Beanfield’s service and expertise will be used in conjunction with our XR facilities to allow the streaming of mixed reality performances, as well as offering new ways for artists outside of TMAC to participate in workshops.\n\nWe can't wait to get you involved in these programs.

While we never should have had to agree to these terms, considering our purchase agreement was finalized in 2014 and contained no such requirement, we agreed in order to bring an end to our legal dispute and secure the space for the benefit of our member organizations and the community.\n\nWhile the original minutes of settlement dictated that the funds must be cash in the bank, the City agreed at a meeting in January that because obtaining ownership of the building is still out of the City’s and TMAC’s direct control and without a timeline, that sponsorship agreements including a condition related to TMAC obtaining title could satisfy the cash obligation – a totally reasonable term for a donor or sponsor. \n\nOur big challenge in fundraising over the last few years has been the uncertainty around when and if TMAC would obtain title. TMAC's mandate is to *operate an arts facility* – how can we ask someone to fund something that does not exist?\n\nOur donors and sponsors have long been concerned about the complexity of our situation, since we’re dependent on at least two other parties to fulfil their obligations – the trustee for Urbancorp's bankruptcy to follow through with the construction work it needs to do to sever the property from the space it will be selling on the commercial market, and the City of Toronto to cease interfering with our right to complete the purchase of the space – in order to take ownership of the building.\n\nThe clarity the January meeting brought allowed us to quickly secure commitments from our sponsors!\n\n### Drumroll, please… 🥁\n\nWe are **very** excited to announce that through partnerships with Virtualware, Beanfield Metroconnect and Ubisoft, we have raised $2.285 million toward our goal. (The difference of $215,000 is made up through revenue generated through our member leases, as allowed under the minutes of settlement.)\n\nWe are genuinely ecstatic to have support from these private sector companies – they get what TMAC is all about and have put in so much time and effort behind the scenes to support us and our member orgs over the years, and especially in the months leading up to now as we've hammered out the finer points of our joint programs. We can't wait to share more about what they will be bringing to TMAC over the next few years, and how you can get involved.\n\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/5128/1555546560-corrected-logo.png)\n"},{"title":"A Year of Art, Culture and Community at TMAC","path":"/news/a-year-of-art-and-culture-at-tmac/","summary":"One year ago this week, we were in the final stages of reaching a settlement with the City of Toronto that would allow us to take occupancy of our space at 32 Lisgar Street – to ensure the continuity of the organizations that make up our membership, and to begin delivering the community benefit that was promised so many years ago.","body":"One year ago this week, we were in the final stages of reaching a settlement with the City of Toronto that would allow us to take occupancy of our space at 32 Lisgar Street – to ensure the continuity of the organizations that make up our membership, and to begin delivering the community benefit that was promised so many years ago.\n\nWe are so proud of what we accomplished here over the past 10 months. With the support of 115 incredible programming partners, the reach and impact of the exhibitions, performances and educational programs have been amplified beyond what any of us could have done alone. That’s the promise of our collaborative space and our community-centred vision of artist-run culture.\n\nAs an all-volunteer team (for now!), we devote our time and energy to TMAC because we know art and technology shapes society. We believe permanent, secure space for artists will create possibilities for new modes of civic engagement, foster community where critical work is being done now, and permanently inform culture in our city.\n\n### 2018's turning point\n\nIn December 2017, three of our four members had reached the end of their leases. We were in a space crisis. There are no affordable alternatives for our organizations to continue to operate in the communities we serve. It’s the reason TMAC was conceived of decades ago, and the reason we took legal action when the City allowed the developer to default on its deal with us in 2015.\n\nFor three months, our members were homeless. We were forced to pause programming and put equipment and art works into storage. It had a catastrophic effect on our operations. In February we finally reached a [settlement](https://www.tomediaarts.org/news/we-have-reached-a-settlement-with-the-city-of-toron) with the City of Toronto and Urbancorp, and moved in to TMAC in March!\n\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/5128/1547926415-img2502.jpg?auto=compress) \n\nSince then, it’s been a whirlwind of activity here as we’ve put all of our energy and resources into fulfilling this commitment to the Toronto arts community and the West Queen West neighbourhood, on top of hitting the ground running with our regular member programming, operating the facility, and working on the $2.5 million fundraising goal the City gave us.\n\n![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/5128/1547955064-clip-october-25-2018-at-700-pm-2018-12-17-213647.gif?auto=compress)\n\nWe’ve supported more than 115 partners – arts nonprofits, community groups, collectives and students – through free or subsidized access to professional exhibition facilities, event and production space.

We’ve been engaged in productive settlement discussions with staff and Urbancorp for over two years, and our members’ leases are up, so we expected they’d support our simple solution to a pressing issue. Hey, the space is empty! _(Except the corner Urbancorp is using as an office…)_\n\nNot only did it outright reject our request, the City seized on this as an opportunity to seek summary judgment terminating our [agreement of purchase and sale](https://tomediaarts.org/docs/TMAC-Edge-City_APS-executed.pdf) and to put an end to our lawsuit.\n\nWhile the monitor was okay with our proposal and willing to lease the space to us, the City not only objected to it without explanation, but also **moved to compel the monitor to lease the space to it instead**! 🤔\n\nWe’re very curious what their plans might be for a purpose-built media arts centre…\n\nWe have a court date set for January 17, where a judge will hear our arguments.\n\n[Want to help? Here’s what you can do.](/help)\n\n#### The City recycles its old defence\n\nIn addition to the motion, we were provided a sworn affidavit by Sally Han, manager of cultural partnerships at the City of Toronto. It parrots many of the wildly inaccurate points included in the City’s original defence to our claim in 2015. It will be easy to respond to, since [we already did… back in 2015](https://www.tomediaarts.org/docs/reply-to-urbancorp-and-cot.pdf).\n\nWe were surprised to find this in Sally’s statement:\n\n> the City had no confidence whatsoever (and still has no confidence whatsoever) that TMAC can successfully operate the Combined Arts and Culture Space for the benefit of the community.\n\n_This is a **shocking contradiction to the City’s public position** that we’ve been making progress working together on an agreement to secure the space._\n\nWhy have the limited resources of an arts charity and four nonprofit community groups been wasted on negotiations the City apparently had no intention of honouring? Why has the City kept the space empty – aside from permitting Urbancorp to use it as an office, an obvious contravention of the nonprofit-arts-use-only [land-use agreement](https://www.tomediaarts.org/docs/Land-Use-Agreement-executed.pdf) they fretted *we* would violate somehow – and blocked the community from enjoying the benefit of a vibrant space for media arts?\n\nWe have no answers.\n\n#### Still pressing forward!\n\nDespite the City’s apparent **contempt for the cultural contributions of our organizations**, our artist members and staff; its disregard for the needs and wishes of the local community; despite our being outrageously out-resourced as a charity up against a multi-billion dollar corporation and an insolvent commercial developer, we’ve hung in here.\n\nOur goals remain the same:\n\n*   Purchase the space we designed, built, and raised $1 million for\n*   Operate it according to our [charitable mandate](https://www.tomediaarts.org/images/addenda/TMAC-Addenda-4-Statement-of-Charitable-Activities.pdf), for the benefit of the West Queen West community, the media arts community, artists, and broader cultural community in Toronto\n*   Support media arts nonprofits and artists by offering a permanent, affordable home for them to do their critical work without the fear and stress of precarity\n\nOur commitment to this project – against the odds – is rooted in a belief that the communities that produce the cultural work that the City of Toronto banks on to attract talent, develop its economy, create jobs and thriving hubs of creative enterprise **should not be trampled by commercial interests and discarded once they’ve made our city worth living in.**\n\nWe continue fighting for this space because every Toronto arts organization – however small – deserves permanence, security and recognition for the work they do to change lives, neighborhoods and our culture.\n\nOur motion for interim occupancy is _simply a request to the City to help us avoid a catastrophic interruption in our services and programming_, which would have a harmful impact on the many thousands of artists, organizers, and community members who frequent our spaces and contribute to the economic and cultural fabric of West Queen West, Toronto and the broader arts community.\n\nAs we stare down the end of our leases and move our equipment and collections into storage and tell our members they have nowhere to work in January, we wonder: What is the City getting out of this?"},{"title":"TMAC to file injunction over arts space at 36 Lisgar","path":"/news/tmac-to-file-injunction-over-arts-space-at-36-lisgar/","summary":"The Toronto Media Arts Centre will ask the court for an injunction to prevent the City from blocking our interim occupancy of the arts space at 36 Lisgar – **a privilege Urbancorp has enjoyed for over a year with the explicit blessing of City staff.**","body":"The Toronto Media Arts Centre will ask the court for an injunction to prevent the City from blocking our interim occupancy of the arts space at 36 Lisgar – **a privilege Urbancorp has enjoyed for over a year with the explicit blessing of City staff.**\n\nTMAC spent 2017 in intense negotiation, working towards a resolution that everyone can live with.

Simply put, we asked the City not to stand in the way of our moving into the space temporarily while the details of the agreement are finalized.\n\n**The City has rejected our proposal and made it plain they will block us from pursuing this relief** – offering no alternative.\n\nThe City of Toronto does not support our efforts to ensure the continuity of media arts in Toronto.

All we have asked is for Urbancorp to deliver on its contractual obligations to us – nothing more, nothing less. The City has always had the ability to compel them to do so, but has not.\n\n### A brief background\n\nIn May 2015, Urbancorp refused to allow us to close on the property because it had not finished work.\n\nAs stewards of public funding, as small non-profits with long histories planning our future as part of this collaborative organization, we could not simply shrug our shoulders and walk away.\n\nWithout the City as an advocate, we had no choice but to protect ourselves by filing a claim against Urbancorp and the City.\n\nIn June of that year – despite our pending litigation – the City [invited the community to a consultation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-ljOD_zQcQ&feature=youtu.be) to determine who should operate the space instead of TMAC. Through no fault of ours, the space was to be handed over to a different group after years of work designing the space, and close to $1 million of public funding secured by TMAC to build and operate it.\n\nThe message from the community at that consultation – attended by 200+ – sent a clear message to the City: **We want TMAC in its space.**\n\nFinally, in October 2015, the City agreed to negotiate a settlement with TMAC and sat down at the table with us.\n\n### Two years of negotiations\n\nThrough two years of negotiations, we have been driven by the support and conviction of local residents, artists, our members and funders, that this space is essential to the future of media arts in Toronto. It’s been hard work. Many hundreds of volunteer hours by our board and members of our nonprofit organizations have been invested in righting our alliance with the City and protecting the community benefit at 36 Lisgar.\n\nWe’ve been very optimistic that a resolution could be reached – despite the complexity introduced by Urbancorp’s filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2016 – because our conversations with the City have been consistently positive and productive. **Unfortunately, the negotiations have not resulted in a settlement.**\n\nThe City’s official position has not changed. From a legal perspective, it does not recognize TMAC’s right to purchase the space. From a policy perspective, it does not support TMAC’s efforts to find a permanent home for Toronto’s media arts community. This is, of course, a deeply disappointing situation given all of the time and effort put into the negotiation process by all parties. But we see no alternative to proceeding with our claim against the City of Toronto. {class=\"alert alert-success\"}\n\nWe’ll be in touch about what you can do to support TMAC very soon.

You can read the whole thing here:  \n[Reply to Edge on Triangle Park and City of Toronto](/docs/reply-to-urbancorp-and-cot.pdf) (PDF)\n\n#### [#](#the-citys-defence) The City’s Defence\n\nThe City claims its conduct was justified as a “good faith attempt to support the City’s objective of ensuring that the Space could be successfully operated for the benefit of the Community.” **Instead, the City’s actions have had the exact opposite effect**, as it knew or should have known they would. If the City had simply fulfilled its obligations, TMAC would already be operating the space and providing a benefit to the community.\n\nInstead, the Space sits vacant with no prospect of the community receiving the promised benefit from it in the foreseeable future. The City’s careless actions may delay operation of the Space for months or years if it does not take steps to begin mediation soon.\n\nThe City attempted to colour the proceedings with an attack on TMAC’s alleged “financial and operational” problems. These allegations are untrue and legally irrelevant — our right to purchase the space was not conditional on the City’s continuing faith in our abilities — and should be disregarded entirely. (We did think the City’s claim that TMAC has “no experience in operating a very large number of events” was particularly funny, having run between our orgs about 1,500 events in the last four years alone.)\n\n#### [#](#urbancorps-defence) Urbancorp’s Defence\n\nUrbancorp’s claim that TMAC’s rights could be terminated by Urbancorp’s own delays is incorrect and ridiculous, contradicted by the plain words of the agreement.\n\nUrbancorp claims that because it did not fulfill its pre-closing obligations by May 3, 2015, its obligations to complete the transaction simply disappeared. **No suggestion has been made that TMAC lost its right to purchase the space through anything it did or failed to do.**\n\nUrbancorp failed to work diligently and in good faith to complete the sale, robbing TMAC of close to $800,000 in investment and four years of work, and the community of the arts and cultural space it was promised.\n\nTMAC remains open to talking to the City about how to resolve this situation. We need Councillor Bailao to meet us halfway and take steps to begin a formal, transparent, accountable process to get everyone to a positive resolution. It’s not too late for the City to take responsibility for its actions and do right by TMAC, Toronto artists and the West Queen West community.\n\n#### [#](#so-whats-next) So, what’s next?\n\nWhile we wait on the City to decide how it wants to proceed (whether to leave the space sitting empty for years or simply talk to us), TMAC continues to operate on the assumption that we will soon be able to occupy the space we designed and built. That means:\n\n*   Operating under our [collaborative governance model](https://governance.tomediaarts.org) as a charitable organization. We don’t have our permanent home yet, but we’ll adapt as we always have to the resources we have and the challenges in front of us.\n*   Planning our inaugural year programming, cinema fitout capital campaign and tenant membership drive.\n*   Developing exciting collaborations and co-presentations for fall/winter 2015 with our members.\n\nWe’re very grateful to our lead donors and funders for their continued support!

We are frankly mystified by the lack of support and facilitation the City provided to ensure Urbancorp did not default on this deal.","body":"### Interference instead of facilitation\n\nDespite a fully executed purchase agreement that obligated Urbancorp to build and deliver this space to TMAC, Urbancorp failed to complete work and close on the property by its deadline.\n\nWith construction nearly done, and TMAC agreeable, there was no reason for Urbancorp not to extend this date in order to give itself time to complete the work and close the transaction.\n\n**Instead, the City of Toronto directed Urbancorp to allow the date to pass, apparently because it intended to hand the facility over to real estate developer Artscape in the final hour.** \\[Edited June 26 to add: Indeed, Artscape CEO Tim Jones [confirmed in the media](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-arts-consortium-launches-lawsuit-over-queen-west-facility/article24958832/) that Artscape became involved in our project at the City’s request weeks before the outside date of our agreement, and **“recommended ‘a reset’ to city officials and the developer”** — despite our rejection of Artscape’s offer of “assistance”\\]\n\nThe role of the City was to facilitate the agreement and ensure Urbancorp delivered on its promises to the community and TMAC. That it failed to do so demonstrates not only bad faith but also a gross breach of community trust.\n\nIn what we believe was an attempt to justify this interference and discredit TMAC, our local Councillor Ana Bailão made unreasonable and irrelevant requests — just weeks before Urbancorp’s deadline — under threat of “canceling” our agreement, which she had no power or authority to do.\n\nWe obliged, but were in effect ignored.\n\nIt is worth noting that Councillor Bailão sits on the [Artscape board of directors](https://www.datocms-assets.com/5128/1555367756-screenshot2019-04-15-our-ambassadors-directors-artscape.png) and Alan Saskin, President of Urbancorp, is the chair of the [Artscape Foundation board of directors](https://www.datocms-assets.com/5128/1555367756-screenshot2019-04-15-our-ambassadors-directors-artscape.png).\n\n### Implications\n\nUrbancorp refused to close the transaction by the deadline, **despite acknowledging TMAC was ready, willing and able to close**. Because of their failure:\n\n*   The agreement was terminated on an easily amendable point intended to _protect_ TMAC, not punish it\n*   Urbancorp is relieved of its obligation to complete and deliver the TMAC space, while still enjoying its lucrative density bonus\n*   We have been forced to take legal action against the City of Toronto and Urbancorp in order to protect our rights\n\nWhile Urbancorp suffers no consequences for its default, and indeed enjoys the profits of its 6-story density increase, TMAC is left to answer to public and private funders who relied on the City’s purported support. Our member organizations are now scrambling to relocate. And four years of cash-strapped arts administrators’ time has been wasted designing, stewarding, and planning a future in a facility that will now be handed over to a different owner.\n\nThe disastrous consequences of the City’s bad faith and Urbancorp’s self-interest apply not only to TMAC and its member organizations, but also to all Toronto arts non-profits. Trust between provincial and federal arts funders and the City will be deeply eroded. The impact of public input on community benefit contributions is in doubt. It’s unlikely another deal like this will ever happen again if the termination of our agreement is not reversed.\n\n### A gross breach of community trust\n\nThe community made its needs clear through the original consultation process in 2011.\n\nNow, despite TMAC’s legal interest in the property, the City of Toronto is attempting to engage the public in a new consultation process to find a different operator for the space — even before responding to our claim.\n\nTMAC remains ready, willing and able to close. **All we want is for Urbancorp to deliver on the promises it made and complete the transaction — nothing more, nothing less.** The City has the authority and right to compel them to do so, and a responsibility to protect this unique Section 37 benefit in West Queen West by facilitating its stewardship by the rightful and intended owner."},{"title":"It's 2020. We're still fighting for this space.","path":"/news/still-fighting/","summary":"This week marks two years since we agreed to a settlement proposed by the City of Toronto and moved into our 30,000 sq. ft. purpose-built arts space at 32 Lisgar Street.\n","body":"But if our successful operation of the facility and [wildly busy calendar of public programming](/events) gives the impression that litigation is over, let’s be clear: **The City continues to obstruct our rights by preventing us from closing the transaction and taking ownership of the building** – despite our clearing every hurdle they’ve put in front of us over the last 5 years.\n\nUntil we get title, we are unable to access the full spectrum of resources we need to operate, such as government grants and partner funding. Til then, we can’t hire staff, [finish the cinema](https://www.tomediaarts.org/tmaction/faqs#when-will-the-cinema-be-finished) or fix any of the problems Urbancorp left behind. We can’t focus all of our attention on maximizing the potential of the space for our members, neighbours and broader arts community until we are secure.\n\nDespite these challenges, we’ve brought two jam-packed years of vibrant programming to a neighbourhood that has struggled  with the displacement of artists and cultural activity since the City’s re-designation of West Queen West as a “Regeneration Zone.” Since April 2018, we’ve hosted more than **450 workshops, receptions, screenings, artist talks, concerts, community and social events plus 45 exhibitions and festivals**; our members are thriving and expanding; neighbours spend their days here working and meeting, checking out art and making plans, socializing and enjoying our view of Lisgar Park.\n\n### Update on legal\n\nLast year, we [secured almost $3 million through partnerships](https://www.tomediaarts.org/news/announcing-our-2019-2024-sponsors/) to fulfill our end of [a settlement we reached with the City](https://www.tomediaarts.org/news/we-have-reached-a-settlement-with-the-city-of-toron/). The agreements are contingent on our receiving title to the building – a completely reasonable condition for anyone making a significant financial commitment, as City staff [agreed at a meeting in January 2019](https://www.tomediaarts.org/news/we-met-our-fundraising-goal/).\n\nBut once we handed over our paperwork, the City changed its mind and said it would not recognize our partnerships after all. It then instructed the third-party adjudicator to disregard our fundraising, then asked us to [declare that we have no right to the space and to leave](https://www.tomediaarts.org/news/an-update-on-the-status-of-our-settlement-with-the-city/).\n\nWe filed a motion to contest the City’s strangely stubborn position in June 2019. Our cross-examination is coming up on Feb 19, 2020.\n\n[Read more background on our 5-year fight to preserve the community benefit at 32 Lisgar](https://www.tomediaarts.org/tmaction)\n\n### The ripple effect\n\nTMAC is clearly able to operate the building in accordance with our charitable mandate and the land-use agreement, support the delivery of the community benefit, fundraise and activate the space.\n\nIf TMAC is delivering everything the City claims it wants for the space and the neighbourhood... what’s the problem? If the City’s real concern is the benefit to the community…\n\n- Why did the City let Urbancorp walk away [without finishing the space](https://www.tomediaarts.org/tmaction/faqs) – despite reaping a $69.2 million density bonus?\n- Why didn’t the City hold the developer to its obligations to the community – no matter who they imagined the eventual operator would be?\n- Why did they allow 9,000 sq. ft. of our third-floor space to be severed in 2018 for Urbancorp’s bankruptcy trustee to sell on the commercial market?\n- Why has the City allowed Urbancorp to occupy part of the TMAC space as an office since 2016, an obvious contravention of the land-use agreement?\n\n**The City’s interference with the transaction in 2015 in effect relieved Urbancorp of its responsibility to finish and deliver the space. Ultimately, it is not only TMAC the City hopes to pin the costs and consequences of its actions on, but also the community that will be deprived of its promised benefit.**\n\nAs we fight to have our fundraising recognized, please keep asking the City these questions. We’d love the answers, too.\n\n**Mike Williams**\n\nGeneral Manager, Economic Development and Culture\n\n[mike.williams@toronto.ca](mailto:mike.williams@toronto.ca)\n\n**Councillor Ana Bailão**\n\nCity of Toronto, Ward 9 Davenport\n\n[councillor_bailao@toronto.ca](mailto:councillor_bailao@toronto.ca)"}]
